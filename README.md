# DiseasePredictionModel

This project is focused on developing a machine learning-based disease prediction system. By leveraging publicly available datasets, the project aims to create an intelligent model capable of predicting diseases based on various input features, such as symptoms and medical parameters. The system will be designed to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early disease detection, thereby improving treatment outcomes.

### Development Goals:
- Collect and preprocess medical datasets for model training.
- Implement feature selection techniques to identify key indicators of diseases.
- Optimize and fine-tune models to achieve high accuracy and reliability.
- Evaluate performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset Used: [Multiple Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehababoelnaga/multiple-disease-prediction/data)
